                        Rice is propagated directly from seed and sown on wet or dry seed beds or used to grow transplants in a nursery bed. Transplants produced in a nursery are always planted in dry seed beds when they are transferred to the field. Seeds may be sown in the field by broadcasting or by mechanical drilling. Three main methods are used for direct seeding rice in lowland areas: dry seedbeds, wet seedbeds and dapog. Dry seedbeds are prepared in close proximity to a water source. Each bed is generally 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in width and is seeded at a rate of 10 kg of seed for every 10 square meters. The seeds are covered with a light layer of soil and the bed is saturated with water until the seeds germinate. Wet seedbeds are raised nursery beds in which pre-germinated seeds are sown. The bed is puddled or wet with water and the germinated seeds are spread out uniformly and kept wet. When the seedling reach 2-3 cm (0.8–1.2 in) in height, shallow irrigation is used and the water levels in the bed are increased as the plants grow. Dapod is a method of producing transplants on a mat made of banana leaves of plastic sheeting which is used in some areas of the Philippines. Pre-germinated seeds are spread out on cement of wet soil and covered with the leaves or plastic sheeting. The cover is pushed down onto the seeds and continuously watered. After 11 days, the mat is rolled up and transferred to to the field. 
Rice can be harvested using the traditional method of cutting by hand. Rice should be cut when 80–85% of the panicles have turned from green to straw colored. When harvested by hand, the rice is cut using sharp knives or sickles. Rice can be  mechanically harvested using threshers or combines.

                        Rice is mainly grown in warmer regions as the plants will not grow at temperatures below 10°C. Rice is considered to be a semi-aquatic annual grass and is commonly grown in paddies in wetlands or under shallow water.Heavy solis for example clay or clay loam are well suited to the rice as they have very good water holding capacity.

                          Planting Wheat varieties should be planted in the Fall approximately 6 to 8 weeks before the first frost date. Wheat should be planted as soon as the soil can be worked in the Spring. Commercially grown wheat is usually mechanically drilled using a machine that creates a furrow and drops the seed in before covering it back up. 
                          Wheat seeds can be sown by hand broadcasting in smaller areas, or using a hand-cranked seeder. Seeds are usually sown to at depths ranging from 2 to 12 cm (0.8–4.7 in) depending on soil conditions (seed must be sown deeper in drier soil). Once the seeds have been scattered, the soil should be raked lightly to set the seeds at the desired depth.
                          Harvesting Wheat is ready to harvest when the stalks and heads have turned from green to yellow and the seed heads are drooping towards the ground. Check the seeds for ripeness before harvest. The should be firm and crunchy and not doughy in texture. Commercially produced wheat is usually harvested using a combine. Smaller plots can be harvested by hand using a scythe or sickle. Small plots can be harvested by snipping off the heads with a pair of scissors.

                            Avoid planting seed from infected fields; avoid overhead irrigation; plant less susceptible cultivars. Control of aphid population can provide some control of disease but is dependent on knowing which aphids are active in the field; planting to avoid periods of peak aphid activity can provide a measure of control. Use good quality seeds. Provide supplemental phosphorous. Sowing when soil temperature is about 50 F increase germination and establishment.

                            Maize can be propagated directly from seed.Planting dates for maize depend on the variety being grown. Standard varieties should be planted when the soil has warmed to at least 12.7°C (55°F) and supersweet varieties when the soil reaches 18.3°C (65°F). Soil can be brought up to temperature faster by laying black plastic mulches approximately 1 week prior to planting. Seeds should be sown about 2.5 cm (1 in) deep and 10–15 cm (~3–4 in) apart allowing 76–91 cm (~30–36 in) between rows. Maize should be planted in blocks (numerous rows) rather than in a single long row as it is wind pollinated and pollen can transfer between plants much more efficiently. Seedlings should be thinned to a final spacing 20–30 cm (8–12 in) when they are approximately 7.5–10.0 cm (3–4 in) in height. It is common to stagger maize plantings to ensure a continuous harvest over the summer months.
                            Each maize stalk should produce 1 large ear of maize. Under ideal conditions, the stalk will produce a second, slightly smaller ear which reaches maturity slightly later than the first. Maize ears should be harvested at the “milk stage” of development, when the kernels within the husk are well packed and produce a milky substance when the kernel is punctured. Check ears for ripeness by gently peeling back a small portion of the husk. Be sure to check the ears frequently for ripeness and harvest as required as ears can quickly become over-ripe and lose their sweetness. Remove the ears from the stalk by pulling quickly downward while twisting and then refrigerate until consumption.

                            Maize is best grown in warm, tropical and sub-tropical regions and clay loamy regions as it requires warm soils to develop optimally. One of the most important requirements for growing maize is a high quality soil which is deep, fertile and well-draining with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8. Maize plants are very heavy feeders and even the most fertile of soils may need to supplemented with nutrients as the plants develop, particularly nitrogen. Maize also requires plenty of space as it grows and is pollinated by wind. It should be planted where it will receive full sunlight for most of the day and provided with ample moisture.                          </div>

                            Charcoal Rot :  <br>
                            Symptoms are usually first apparent at the tasseling stage; plant stalks become shredded and pith is completely rotted with stringy strands of vascular tissue left intact; small, black fungal fruiting bodies are visible in the vascular strands and give the tissue a gray coloration; fungus grows into internodes of the stalk causing the plant to ripen early and causing the stalk to weaken; plant may break.
                             <br>Common Rust : <br>
                            Oval or elongated cinnamon brown pustules on upper and lower surfaces of leaves; pustules rupture and release powdery red spores; pustules turn dark brown-black as they mature and release dark brown powdery spores; if infection is severe, pustules may appear on tassels and ears and leaves may begin to yellow; in partially resistant corn hybrids, symptoms appear as chlorotic or necrotic flecks on the leaves which release little or no spore.
                            <br>Bacterial Stalk Rot : <br>
                            Plants suddenly beginning to lodge (bend to lie along the ground) midway through season; one or more internodes above soil line turning brown, water-soaked, soft and slimy; tissue has foul odor and mushy appearance;
                           <br> Stewart’s Wilt : <br>
                            The main symptoms are appearance of water soaked lesions initially. As the disease progress the lesions become long and turn pale yellow with irregular margins running in the length. The pathogen may infect the stem and causes stunting, wilting and death of plant.

                              Nitrogen (N) is a macronutrient for corn. An estimate of N requirements for corn is 1 lb of N is needed for every bushel of grain produced, so a 200 bu corn crop would require 200 lb of N. A relatively new concept in N application rates is referred to as maximum return to N.                            </div>

                              Grow available resistant varieties. Use certified healthy seeds. Remove the crop debris and burn them. Use suitable insecticide to control flea beetle. Plow all crop debris into soil in Fall; plant corn in well-draining soil to prevent waterlogged plants.Avoid stressing plants by practicing good water management.Rotate crops with small grains may help reduce disease incidence.

                              The most effective method of controlling diseases is to plant resistant hybrids; application of appropriate fungicides may provide some degree on control and reduce disease severity; fungicides are most effective when the amount of secondary inoculum is still low, generally when plants only have a few rust pustules per leaf.
